# Smart Shopper API 🛒

This project is a high-performance, real-time product information pipeline built with Django and Django Rest Framework. It fetches product data from Google Shopping, focusing on speed and scalability through aggressive caching with Redis and asynchronous data fetching.

This system was built to address the "Smart Shopper's Dilemma," where a user expects instant product search results without any delay.

***

## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-time Search**: Fetches up-to-date product information on demand.
* **High Performance**: Uses a Redis cache to serve repeated requests in milliseconds.
* **Asynchronous**: Leverages `asyncio` to perform slow I/O operations (like web scraping) efficiently.
* **Reliable Data**: Integrates with the SerpApi service to handle the complexities of web scraping and avoid getting blocked.
* **RESTful API**: Exposes a clean, simple API endpoint for easy integration with any client application.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Backend**: Python, Django, Django Rest Framework
* **Caching**: Redis
* **Scraping**: SerpApi, `asyncio`
* **Environment Management**: `venv`, `python-dotenv`

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Docker Desktop (for running Redis)
* A SerpApi API Key

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/smart-shopper-api.git](https://github.com/your-username/smart-shopper-api.git)
    cd smart-shopper-api
    ```

2.  **Set Up the Environment**
    Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
    ```powershell
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (on Windows PowerShell)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    Install all required packages.
    ```bash
    pip install django djangorestframework django-redis redis aiohttp google-search-results python-dotenv asgiref
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add your SerpApi key.
    ```
    # .env
    SERPAPI_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Start Redis**
    Make sure Docker Desktop is running, then start the Redis container in the background.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --name my-redis redis
    ```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  **Apply Migrations**
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

2.  **Start the Django Server**
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

## 🤖 API Usage

Make a GET request to the search endpoint with a product query.

* **Endpoint**: `/api/products/search/`
* **Method**: `GET`
* **Query Parameter**: `q=<product_name>`

### Example Request

```bash
curl "[http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/search/?q=organic+creamy+peanut+butter](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products/search/?q=organic+creamy+peanut+butter)"

```

### Example Response

The first request (cache miss) will be slower. Subsequent requests for the same query (cache hit) will be nearly instantaneous.

```json
[
    {
        "title": "365 by Whole Foods Market, Peanut Butter Creamy Organic, 16 Ounce",
        "brand": "Whole Foods Market",
        "price": "$5.49",
        "weight": "16 Ounce",
        "link": "[https://www.google.com/shopping/product/](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/)..."
    },
    {
        "title": "Kirkland Signature Organic Creamy Peanut Butter, 28 Ounce, 2 Count",
        "brand": "Costco",
        "price": "$12.99",
        "weight": "28 Ounce",
        "link": "[https://www.google.com/shopping/product/](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/)..."
    }
]
```
